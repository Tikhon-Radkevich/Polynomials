# Polynomial Regression Model for Predicting Y-Coordinates

This project demonstrates a Python implementation of a polynomial regression model designed to predict Y-coordinates based on input X-values. The model is implemented without using popular data science libraries like NumPy, scikit-learn, or TensorFlow, making it a self-contained and educational example.

## Features

- Polynomial regression up to the 5th degree.
- Model fitting and prediction.
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) calculation for evaluating predictions.
